High Priestess Morelyn:<br>

I've been waiting for you. A<font color="LEVEL"> Mysterious Dark 
 Knight</font> had come to see me some time ago. He 
 looked dressed in some water..er, hum. Never 
 mind. I'm just talking to myself.<br>

 Anyway, this knight told me that one day I'd be 
 visited by someone with a letter from him, 
 someone who commands the power of the 
 Giants.<br>

 So, what do you want to ask me?<br>
